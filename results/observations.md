# Training and Evaluation Observations

- The model showed rapid improvement in accuracy from the first epoch itself.
- Training accuracy increased consistently from 84.35% to 99.46% by the final epoch.
- Training loss decreased steadily, indicating effective learning and convergence.
- Validation accuracy remained stable between 96% and 97% across epochs.
- The highest validation accuracy of 97.25% was observed at Epoch 9.
- Slight fluctuations in validation loss were observed, which is expected in neural network training.
- The final model generalizes well to unseen data without significant overfitting.

These observations are based on the accuracy and loss values printed during
model training and evaluation in the notebook.
