# Sample Model Outputs

The trained neural network produces probability scores for each digit class (0–9).
The digit with the highest probability is selected as the final prediction.

## Prediction Behaviour Observed
- The model successfully predicts handwritten digit classes from pixel-based input.
- Predictions generated during evaluation match the expected digit labels in most cases.
- The model outputs a probability distribution over all digit classes for each input sample.

Sample predictions and classification behaviour are demonstrated in the notebook
during the model evaluation phase.
